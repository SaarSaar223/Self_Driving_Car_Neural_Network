Self Driving Car Neural Network
This project aims to develop a self-driving car neural network, a small-scale simulation that showcases the capabilities of artificial intelligence in autonomous vehicle control. 
The neural network is designed to control a simulated car by making intelligent driving decisions based on input from various sensors. The goal of the neural network is to complete the
track in the smallest amount of time.

The self-driving car neural network utilizes Python and popular machine learning libraries to train and evaluate the model. By leveraging a deep neural network architecture, 
the system processes sensor data and generates control signals for the simulated car, allowing it to navigate the virtual environment autonomously.
